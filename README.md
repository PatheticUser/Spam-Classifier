![Spam Shield](https://png.pngtree.com/png-vector/20220609/ourmid/pngtree-green-shield-icon-for-web-design-isolated-on-white-background-png-image_4839869.png)

Spam Shield is a **machine learning-powered spam detector** built with **Streamlit**, **NLTK**, and **Scikit-Learn**. It efficiently classifies messages as **spam or not spam** using **natural language processing (NLP) techniques** and a **trained classifier**.

## 🔥 Features

✅ **Real-time Spam Detection:** Instantly analyze SMS and emails for spam content.  
✅ **Bulk Message Analysis:** Upload a CSV file and classify multiple messages at once.  
✅ **AI-Powered Precision:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization and a trained model for accurate predictions.  
✅ **Performance Insights:** Get model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
✅ **Beautiful UI:** A modern, dark-themed Streamlit interface for smooth user experience.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**

   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Removes punctuation & stopwords
   - Applies stemming for normalization

2. **Machine Learning Model**

   - Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.
   - Classifies messages using a **pre-trained spam detection model**.

3. **Interactive UI**
   - Paste a message and get instant spam detection.
   - Upload a CSV for bulk message classification.
   - View model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
